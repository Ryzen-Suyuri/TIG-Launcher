PUBLIC MEMBERS
- Level(): failsafe for if no parameters are given
- Level(char const*): call loadDataFromFile and pass its parameter
- ~Level(): deconstructor
- loadDataFromFile(char const*): load level data from path given by the parameter
- writeDataToFile(char const*): write data to path given by parameter
- getFormatVer(): get the file format version, returns an int
- getBlockAtIndex(int): returns the BlockObj at the given int if it exists, returns an empty BlockObj otherwise
- getBgConAtIndex(int): returns the BgCon at the given int if it exists, returns an empty BgCon otherwise
- getGravityAtIndex(int): returns the GravityChange at the given int if it exists, returns an empty GravityChange otherwise
- getRisingAtIndex(int): returns the RisingBlocks at the given int if it exists, returns an empty RisingBlocks otherwise
- getFallingAtIndex(int): returns the FallingBlocks at the given int if it exists, returns an empty FallingBlocks otherwise
- getEndPos(): return the x position of the end wall as an int
- getObjCount() through getFallingCount(): return the size of the corresponding vectors
- addNewBlock(BlockObj) through addFallingBlocks(FallingBlocks): add the provided object to the corresponding vector, and increment the associated private member
- setEndPos(int): set the position of the end wall to the given parameter
- remove____AtIndex(int): removes the object at the given index from the appropriate vector, if the given index is in bounds
- removeLast____(): removes the last entry from the appropriate vector, if the appropriate vector isn't empty
- printAllInfo(): currently does nothing
